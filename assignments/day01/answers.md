## What is Linux?

Linux is the best-known and most-used open source operating system. As an operating system, Linux is software that sits underneath all of the other software on a computer, receiving requests from those programs and relaying these requests to the computer’s hardware.

## Why use Linux? What are the pros and cons?
Unlike other operating systems like Windows or OS, Linux offers some pretty great features that don’t compare in terms of freedom and open sourcing

#### Pros
- It is very easy to install and you don’t need to install it all straight away
- If you have a bit of developer in you and know what you are doing you change Linux to suit you. 
- It’s free! You do not have to pay for it.
- You can distribute your changes in Linux to help others.
- It is known for being a more stable and secure system.
- The chances of getting a virus on Linux are notably lower than other operating systems. 
- It consumes very little resources and space unlike Windows.
- It is a very smart and powerful system, you practically have power over whatever you want and configure almost everything.
- There is community support for troubleshooting.

#### Cons
- It isn’t as user friendly as Windows.
- There isn’t a dedicated tech support, so getting ‘fixes’ for things is in your hands unless you want to subscribe to Enterprise Linux.
- Drivers don’t really exist, there will be work arounds but users have reported problems when trying to use certain hardwares or old hardwares.
- It’s probably better used as a dual boot rather than a Windows replacement due to the fact you can’t get propriety programs on it and although they offer cousins, it won’t be the same.
