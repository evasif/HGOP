# Docker Exercise
Getting to know Docker, how it works and linking containers together so they can connect. 

## What is Docker?
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. 

## What is the difference between:
* Virtual Machine
* Docker Container
* Docker Image

Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. Unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. A Docker container is an active (or inactive if exited) stateful instantiation of an image. A Docker image is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime.

## Web API?
APIs let developers integrate two parts of an application, or two different applications together. Web APIs are the same, excepts used for communications through the Internet. It consists of elements as functions, protocols and other tools that allow developers to build applciations.

## Postgres?
Postgres is an object-relational database management system with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance. It is free and an open source software, which means that the source code is open to everyone.

## package.json file dependencies field:
A package.json file is a file that stores simple data structures and objects in JSON format, which is a standard data interchange format. It is primarily used for transmitting data between a web application and a server. JSON files are lightweight, text-based, human-readable, and can be edited using a text editor.

## NPM express package:
It is a web application framework for Node.js, has been called the standard server framework for Node.js. Is is released as an open-source software undir the MIT licence and is designed for building web applications and APIs.

## NPM pg package:
node-postgres is a collection of node.js modules to connecting with your PostgreSQL database. It has support for callbacks, promises, async/await, connection pooling, prepared statements, cursors, streaming results and more.

## What is docker-compose:
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
(From: https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Results
What we learned was what Docker is, how to use it and it's most common commands. We learned the difference between an Image and a Container and the process of using Docker Compose. We learned how to create an image, run the instance of it and how to store our image on Docker cloud. We now know how to use post and get request on the Docker compose and saw the results.
